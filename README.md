# 📊 Life Expectancy Data Analysis – WHO Dataset

This project is part of my college Statistics assignment (Activity 3), where I explored global health and development data to understand how **Life Expectancy**, **GDP**, and **Schooling** are related.

I used tools like **Google Sheets** for data handling and visualization, and **Google Docs** for writing my report. This project helped me understand real-world applications of statistics such as **mean**, **standard deviation**, **covariance**, and **Chebyshev's Inequality**.

## 📈 Key Analysis Steps

1. Selected 3 main variables: Life Expectancy, GDP, and Schooling
2. Cleaned the dataset (removed missing values)
3. Created scatter plots to visualize relationships
4. Calculated:
   - Covariance
   - Mean & Standard Deviation
   - Chebyshev’s Inequality bounds
5. Interpreted the results in a structured report
